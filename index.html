        <h1 class="title">The importance of protective masks</h1>
        <div>
            <p class="intro">Wearing a face mask will help prevent the spread of infection and prevent the individual from contracting any airborne infectious germs. When someone coughs, talks, sneezes they could release germs into the air that may infect others nearby. Face masks are part of an infection control strategy to eliminate cross-contamination.</p></div>

        <h3>How the virus that causes Covid-19 spreads?</h3>
        <div class="text">
            <p class="inner_paragraph">To understand why face masks might work, it is important to look at how the virus that causes Covid-19 spreads in the first place.</p>
            <p class="inner_paragraph">Once it has infected someone, the Sars-CoV-2 virus responsible for the disease hijacks their cells to replicate itself. As it multiplies, these new virus particles then burst out of the cells and become suspended in the bodily fluids in our lungs, mouth and nose. When an infected person coughs, they can send showers of tiny droplets – known as aerosols – filled with the virus into the air.Once out of our mouths, many of the larger droplets will quickly settle onto nearby surfaces while smaller ones remain suspended in the air for hours, where they can be breathed in. The Sars-CoV-2 virus has been found to survive in these aerosol droplets for at least three hours.</p>
            <p class="inner_paragraph">An unpublished analysis of 318 outbreaks of Covid-19 in China showed that it was most commonly transmitted in indoor environments, particularly in people’s homes, but also on public transport, in restaurants, cinemas and shops. Genetic material from Sars-CoV-2 has also been detected in the air in toilets and rooms used by people infected with Covid-19.</p>
        </div>
        <h3>How wearing protective masks could help to stop the virus?</h3>
        <div class="text">
            <p class="inner_paragraph">“Face masks could help to reduce transmission in the community particularly if used in public transport and crowded areas,” says Ben Cowling, head of epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of Hong Kong.</p>
            <p class="inner_paragraph">One of the reasons widespread, public face mask wearing is so important with Covid-19 has to do with the prevalence of asymptomatic carriers who can still spread the virus to others. Add to this an incubation period of around five days, but up to 14 days in some cases, before symptoms develop and even those who do go on to show signs of being contagious can spread the virus to a lot of people before they start to fall ill.</p>
            <p class="inner_paragraph">“This makes it particularly difficult to suppress transmission in the community,” says Cowling. “But if everybody is wearing face masks, that would mean infected and asymptomatic people are also wearing masks. That could help to reduce the amount of virus which gets into the environment and potentially causes infections.”</p>
            <p class="inner_paragraph">Modelling work at the University of Cambridge showed that routine facemask use while in public by 50% or more of the pupulation could bring down the infection rate – also known as the reproduction (R) number – to less than one, helping to flatten the spread of the disease. The more people who adopted masks, and the earlier they were implemented in an outbreak, the better the outcome, even if using homemade masks made from dishcloths or old t-shirts. "We have little to lose from the widespread adoption of facemasks, but the gains could be significant,” says Renata Retkute, an epidemiologist at the University of Cambridge, who was one of those involved in the study.</p>
            <p id="important"><span>While face masks might bring a little discomfort, and make it harder to spot the facial expressions of those we are talking to, those things are a small price to pay for keeping the people around us safe and well.</span></p>
